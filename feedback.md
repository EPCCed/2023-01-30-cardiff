## Shell (day 1)

### The good
 - Explained very well. Some useful commands - which were expanded on for different uses.
 - Good that went from basics and gave lots of examples.
 - Well explained. Easy to follow. Gauge level of difficulty (I covered the context in the past). Maybe more advanced would have been great!
 - Good overview about how common command is bash can be used, and how combination make it more powerful.
 - Clear delivery + provided a lot of help.
 - I like the post-it note system for asking for help.
 - It's a good course for beginners. Hope teachers could take it a bit slow when showing us the coding, thanks!
 - Thanks, Juan and Jose. This course is quite useful! I have tutorials for this afternoon. Will come back tomorrow morning. See you tomorrow!
 - Excellent experience learn a lot in short time. There should be more such courses, face to face learning.
 
### The bad
 - Sometimes went too fast, so I started to get a bit lost + stressed.
 - Task instructions could be clearer.
 - Could be more interactive, cover the basics quicker, and let us play/guide through examples.
 - Lack of practical example although it understandable that variety of attendance's expertise.
 - More detail in automating tasks.
 - Exercises could be explained more clearly (the expectations, not solutions).
 - Pace could be quicker.

## R (day 2)

### The good
 - Clear tasks + answers. Enjoyed plotting part.
 - Very good experience. There should be more face to face courses like this.

### The bad
 - In the timetable it says about using `knitr` for reproducible analysis - this would have been useful.
